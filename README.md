# Sentiment Analysis for Customer Reviews

**Project Overview:**

This project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze the sentiment of customer reviews using the Python NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) module. It's designed to determine whether a given review is positive or negative. The core idea is to help businesses gain insights into customer sentiment regarding their products or services.

**Features:**

- Utilizes the NLTK module: NLTK provides a powerful set of tools for text analysis, including text tokenization, stemming, and sentiment analysis.
- Amazon Review Dataset: The project uses a dataset of Amazon product reviews to train and test the sentiment analysis model. This dataset covers a wide range of products and includes a diversity of customer opinions.
- Accuracy: The model built for sentiment analysis achieves an accuracy of 78.63%. This accuracy metric indicates the model's capability to correctly classify reviews as positive or negative.

**How it Works:**

1. Data Preprocessing: The project starts by preprocessing the text data, which involves tasks like tokenization (breaking text into words or phrases), removing stop words, and stemming (reducing words to their root form).
2. Training the Model: The Amazon Review Dataset is used to train the sentiment analysis model. The model learns to recognize patterns in the text data and assign sentiment labels.
3. Sentiment Analysis: Once trained, the model can analyze new customer reviews and predict whether they express a positive or negative sentiment.
4. Output: The project provides an easy-to-use interface for inputting customer reviews, and it returns the sentiment classification as either "Positive" or "Negative."

**Why Use Sentiment Analysis:**

- Business Insights: Sentiment analysis is a valuable tool for businesses to gain insights into customer opinions and preferences. It can help companies make data-driven decisions to improve their products or services.
- Customer Feedback: By understanding customer sentiment, businesses can better address customer needs and issues, leading to improved customer satisfaction.
- Trend Analysis: Sentiment analysis can be used to identify trends and shifts in customer sentiment over time, helping companies adapt and stay competitive in the market.
